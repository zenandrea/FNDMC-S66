## Paper abstract

The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a wide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to aqueous solutions and many more.
Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent interactions.
However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules, recent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than 7.5 kcal/mol for larger systems.
The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown, and the absence of systematic comparisons, especially for medium-sized complexes, prevents us from identifying which systems where such disagreement may occur as well as the possible extent of these differences.
In this work, we leverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the entire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions.
Comparison to CCSD(T) reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting stronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the binding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems.
We show that the relative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of electrostatic and dispersion interaction, as obtained from energy decomposition analysis methods.
These new insights set the stage for guiding future developments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory community.
